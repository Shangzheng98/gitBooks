# 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List

Given the `head` of a linked list, remove the `nth` node from the end of the list and return its head.



For this question, we can slide the search window bounded by two-pointer, the distance of two pointers is `n`

And the head maybe become null, so we use the dummy node to avoid some corner case.



TC:O(n);

SC: O(1);

```java
public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
        
    ListNode d = new ListNode(0);
    d.next = head;
    ListNode first = d;
    
    ListNode second = d;
    
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= n + 1;i++) {
        second = second.next;
    }
    
    
    while (second != null) {
        first = first.next;
        second = second.next;
    }
    first.next = first.next.next;
    
    return d.next;
}
```
