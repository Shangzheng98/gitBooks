# 213. Reconstruct Binary Tree With Preorder And Inorder

Given the preorder and inorder traversal sequence of a binary tree, reconstruct the original tree.

**Assumptions**

* The given sequences are not null and they have the same length
* There are no duplicate keys in the binary tree

**Examples**

preorder traversal = {5, 3, 1, 4, 8, 11}

inorder traversal = {1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 11}

the corresponding binary tree is

&#x20;       5

&#x20;     /    \\

&#x20;   3        8

&#x20; /   \        \\

1      4        11
