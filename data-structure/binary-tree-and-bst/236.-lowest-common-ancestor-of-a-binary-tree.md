# 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest\_common\_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”



TC: O(N)

SC: O(N)

```java
public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
    if ( root == null) {
        return null;
    }
    
    if (p == root || q == root) {
        return root;
    }
    
    TreeNode leftLCA = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p,q);
    TreeNode rightLCA = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
    
    if (leftLCA != null && rightLCA != null) {
        return root;
    }
    
    return leftLCA == null ? rightLCA : leftLCA;
}
```
