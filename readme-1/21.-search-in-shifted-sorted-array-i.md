# 21. Search In Shifted Sorted Array I

Given a target integer T and an integer array A, A is sorted in ascending order first, then shifted by an arbitrary number of positions.

For Example, A = {3, 4, 5, 1, 2} (shifted left by 2 positions). Find the index i such that A\[i] == T or return -1 if there is no such index.



As in the binary search, we maintain two pointers `left` and `right.` Because the array is rotated, so there are two parts divided by the rotation index, and all elements in the second part is always smaller than all elements in the first part.

* &#x20;if array\[middle] == target, return the middle as the index
*   Now, there are two situations

    1. the `array[middle] > array[left]`, so that means the subarray from left to middle is in the first part.

    if the target is in this subarray:

    * right = middle - 1;

    else&#x20;

    * right = middle - 1;
*   the array\[middle] < array\[left], so the subarray is in the second part.

    if the target is in subarray of second part:

    * left = left = 1;

    else

    * right = right - 1;

```java
public int search(int[] array, int target) {
    if (array == null || array.length == 0) {
        return -1;
    }
    
    int left = 0;
    int right = array.length;
    
    while (left <= right) {
        int middle = left + (right - left) / 2 ;
        
    }
}
```
